# Quick Quote

Quick Quote is a tool used to produce basic quotes on construction jobs based on the cost of material, labour and travel. The application will also produce a .txt file which can be sent to the applicant via text and email.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

You will also be required to provide you own Google API key for Geocoder, a Gmail account, as well as a custom twilio account. More information on these processes can be found in the links below.
